        <h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>I am happy and responsible and would like to do everything new in my life. I'm excited to learn and become a developer, as it's the first experience in my academic consultation. I'll do everything in my power to achieve what I started. I am 34 years old, born in Iraq, and finished my study between three countries (Iraq, India, and Georgia). Personally, I like to experience everything, had worked extensively in my home country and other countries, through which I got the certificates I wanted and learned the languages. I'm not afraid to try new challenges and I'd love to grow my professional ability. I can handle stress. I'm social, like to meet new people, and find it easy to work independently and in teams.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to train and exercise, which makes me feel good.</p>
